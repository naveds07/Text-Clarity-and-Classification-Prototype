He also did field work himself in Western Europe and South America. His wife shared his interest in natural history, and accompanied him on collecting trips. In 1896, when William Henry Flower took control of the department, he hired Richard Lydekker to rearrange the exhibitions, allowing Thomas to concentrate on these new specimens.Thomas viewed his taxonomy efforts from the scope of British imperialism. \\\"You and I in our scientific lives have seen the general knowledge of Mammals of the world wonderfully advanced \\u2013 there are few or no blank areas anymore,\\\" he said in a letter to Gerrit Smith Miller Jr.Officially retired from the museum in 1923, he continued his work without interruption. Although popular rumours suggested he died by shooting himself with a handgun while sitting at his museum desk, he actually died at home in 1929, aged 71, about a year after the death of his wife, \\\"a severe blow from which he never recovered.\\\"\",\n          \"Disraeli always considered foreign affairs to be the most critical and interesting part of statesmanship. Nevertheless, his biographer Robert Blake doubts that his subject had specific ideas about foreign policy when he took office in 1874. He had rarely travelled abroad; since his youthful tour of the Middle East in 1830\\u20131831, he had left Britain only for his honeymoon and three visits to Paris, the last of which was in 1856. As he had criticised Gladstone for a do-nothing foreign policy, he most probably contemplated what actions would reassert Britain's place in Europe. His brief first premiership, and the first year of his second, gave him little opportunity to make his mark in foreign affairs.\",\n          \"I have sent your Watch at last & envy the felicity of it, that it should be soe near your side & soe often enjoy your Eye. ... .but have a care for it, for I have put such a spell into it; that every Beating of the Balance will tell you 'tis the Pulse of my Heart, which labors as much to serve you and more trewly than the Watch; for the Watch I beleeve will sometimes lie, and sometimes be idle & unwilling ... but as for me you may be confident I shall never ...\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"has_entity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"ORG_YES_PRODUCT_YES_PERSON_NO_\",\n          \"ORG_YES_PRODUCT_NO_PERSON_NO_\",\n          \"ORG_NO_PRODUCT_YES_PERSON_YES_\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lexicon_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 63,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 653,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 348,\n        \"samples\": [\n          237,\n          82,\n          274\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"difficult_words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 16.307358092882417,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 143.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 113,\n        \"samples\": [\n          96.0,\n          36.0,\n          15.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"last_editor_gender\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"non-binary\",\n          \"prefer_not_to_say\",\n          \"man\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Biographies\",\n          \"artificial intelligence\",\n          \"Philosophy\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_clarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"not_clear_enough\",\n          \"clear_enough\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He also did field work himself in Western Europe and South America. His wife shared his interest in natural history, and accompanied him on collecting trips. In 1896, when William Henry Flower took control of the department, he hired Richard Lydekker to rearrange the exhibitions, allowing Thomas to concentrate on these new specimens.Thomas viewed his taxonomy efforts from the scope of British imperialism. \\\"You and I in our scientific lives have seen the general knowledge of Mammals of the world wonderfully advanced \\u2013 there are few or no blank areas anymore,\\\" he said in a letter to Gerrit Smith Miller Jr.Officially retired from the museum in 1923, he continued his work without interruption. Although popular rumours suggested he died by shooting himself with a handgun while sitting at his museum desk, he actually died at home in 1929, aged 71, about a year after the death of his wife, \\\"a severe blow from which he never recovered.\\\"\",\n          \"Disraeli always considered foreign affairs to be the most critical and interesting part of statesmanship. Nevertheless, his biographer Robert Blake doubts that his subject had specific ideas about foreign policy when he took office in 1874.

As he had criticised Gladstone for a do-nothing foreign policy, he most probably contemplated what actions would reassert Britain's place in Europe.
